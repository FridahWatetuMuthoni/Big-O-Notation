# Combinations Notes

Hey there! Sure, I'll explain the code to you in a simple way.

So, imagine you have three letters: 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The code is like a magic function that will give you all the possible combinations of these letters.

Here's how it works step by step:

1. First, the function is called with the letters ['a', 'b', 'c'].
2. The function checks if the list of letters is empty. But it's not, so it moves on.
3. Then, it takes the first letter, which is 'a', and keeps it aside.
4. Next, it calls itself again, but this time with the remaining letters ['b', 'c'] (without 'a').
5. This step is like magic! The function will repeat the process for the smaller list of letters ['b', 'c'].
6. It will take the first letter of this smaller list, which is 'b', and keep it aside.
7. Again, it will call itself with the even smaller list ['c'] (without 'b').
8. This process will repeat one last time with the remaining letter 'c'.

Now, the magic happens as it starts putting the combinations together:

1. For the smallest list with just one letter 'c', it creates a combination: [['c']].
2. Then, it goes to the list with two letters ['b', 'c'] and creates combinations using the previous result. So, it adds 'b' to 'c', and we get [['b', 'c']].
3. Now, it goes to the list with three letters ['a', 'b', 'c'] and uses the previous results again. It adds 'a' to each of the combinations from step 2. So, we get [['a', 'b', 'c']] and [['a', 'c']].
4. Finally, it combines all the results from step 1, 2, and 3 to give you the answer: [['c'], ['b', 'c'], ['a', 'b', 'c'], ['a', 'c']].

And that's it! The function gives you all the possible combinations of the letters ['a', 'b', 'c'].
