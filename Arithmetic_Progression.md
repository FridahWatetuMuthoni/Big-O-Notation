# Arithmetic Progression

An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is always the same. This difference is called the common difference (d). In simpler terms, it's a sequence of numbers where you add or subtract the same value to get to the next term.

For example, let's consider the sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ...

In this sequence, the common difference is 3 because we add 3 to each term to get to the next term.

Now, let's go through the important formulas related to arithmetic progressions:

## nth Term Formula

The formula to find the nth term (or general term) of an arithmetic progression is:
an = a1 + (n - 1) * d
In this formula:

an represents the nth term of the AP.
a1 is the first term of the AP.
n is the position of the term in the sequence.
d is the common difference.
For example, if we want to find the 6th term (n = 6) of the sequence mentioned above, we can use the formula:
a6 = a1 + (6 - 1) *d
= 2 + 5* 3
= 2 + 15
= 17

Therefore, the 6th term of the sequence is 17.

## Sum of Terms Formula

The formula to find the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression is:
Sn = (n/2) *(2a1 + (n - 1)* d)
In this formula:

Sn represents the sum of the first n terms of the AP.
a1 is the first term of the AP.
n is the number of terms in the sequence.
d is the common difference.
For example, if we want to find the sum of the first 5 terms (n = 5) of the sequence we mentioned earlier, we can use the formula:
S5 = (5/2) *(2* 2 + (5 - 1) *3)
= (5/2)* (4 + 12)
= (5/2) * 16
= 40

Therefore, the sum of the first 5 terms of the sequence is 40.

These are the main formulas related to arithmetic progressions. By using these formulas, you can find any term in the sequence or calculate the sum of a given number of terms. Arithmetic progressions are used in various mathematical and real-life applications, such as calculating series, financial calculations, and analyzing patterns in data.
